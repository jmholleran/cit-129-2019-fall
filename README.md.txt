## Goals in Python 2
My goal in Python 2 is to learn useful skills in Python to help with my job and future learning endeavors.

I have taken courses in Data Analytics, Python 1 and Java, as of Fall 2019, and would like to further my programming skills.

I'd like to learn more with web scraping and data analytics, such as NumPy, BeautifulSoup, and other modules I'm not aware of currently.
